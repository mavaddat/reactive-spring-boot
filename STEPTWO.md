This second step shows how to create a Java client that will connect to
an endpoint that emits a stream of server-sent events. We'll be using a
TDD-inspired process to create the client and test it.

This is the second part in our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and JavaFX. The original
inspiration was a [70 minute live
demo,](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)
which I have split into a series of shorter videos with an accompanying
blog post, explaining each of the steps more slowly and in more detail.

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

This second step creates a [Reactive Spring Java
client](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html)
that connects to a REST service that's streaming stock prices once a
second. This client will be used in later sections of the tutorial.

### Create a project for the client

We're going to create a [new
project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-project-wizard.html)
for this client, we want to keep the client and server code completely
separate as they should run completely independently.

1.  This project will have multiple modules in, so start by selecting
    empty project from the choices on the left of the [New Project
    Wizard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-project-wizard.html).
2.  Call the project stock-client and press Finish.
3.  By default IntelliJ IDEA shows the modules section of the Project
    Structure dialog when a new empty project is created. [Add a new
    module](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-modules.html#add-new-module)
    here, this will be a Spring Boot module so [choose Spring Initializr
    on the
    left](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html#create-spring-boot-project).
4.  We're using Java 13 as the SDK for this tutorial, although we're not
    using any of the Java 13 features (you can [download JDK
    13.0.1](http://jdk.java.net/13/) here, then [define a new IntelliJ
    IDEA SDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#define-sdk)
    for it).
5.  Enter the group name for the project, and we'll use stock-client as
    the name.
6.  Enter a useful description for the module so it's clear what the
    purpose of this code is.
7.  Keep the defaults of creating a Maven project with Java as the
    language.
8.  We'll select Java 11 as the Java version as this is the [most recent
    Long Term
    Support](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/09/using-java-11-in-production-important-things-to-know/)
    version for Java, but for the purposes of this project it makes no
    difference.
9.  We can optionally change the default package structure if we wish.

Next we'll select the [Spring Boot
Starters](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters)
that we need.

1.  Use Spring Boot 2.2.0 RC1 because we'll need some features from this
    version in later videos of this tutorial.
2.  Select the Spring Reactive Web starter and Lombok too.
3.  The defaults for module name and location are fine so we'll keep
    them as they are.

IntelliJ IDEA will use Spring Initializr to create the project and then
import it correctly into the IDE. If given the option, [enable
auto-import on
Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-importing.html#auto_import)
so when we make changes to the pom.xml file the project dependencies
will automatically be refreshed.

### Create the client class

1.  Delete the StockClientApplication that Spring Initializr has created
    for the project, we don't need this for this module, as this module
    is going to be a library that other applications use not an
    application in its own right.
2.  Create a Java class WebClientStockClient, this is going to use
    Spring's
    [WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-webclient)
    to connect to the stock prices service.

``` java
public class WebClientStockClient {

}
```

### Create the client's test

One way to drive out the requirements for our client, and to see if it
actually works, is to develop it in a test driven way.

1.  Using Ctrl+Shift+T for Windows or Linux (ΓçºΓîÿT on macOS) we can
    navigate to the test for a class. If we do this from
    WebClientStockClient we see we don't have one yet for this class.
    Choose the "Create New Test" option, which will show the [Create
    Test dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-test.html).
2.  Choose [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
    as the testing framework (note that IntelliJ IDEA offers a range of
    testing frameworks to choose from).
3.  This is actually going to be an end-to-end test so enter
    WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest as the class name
4.  Generate a test method using Alt+Insert (ΓîÿN) and selecting "Test
    Method" from the generate menu.
5.  This is not going to be a perfect example of test driven
    development, as we're going to just create a single test which looks
    at only the best case, sometimes called the [happy
    path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path). Call the test
    something like shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService.
6.  Create an instance of WebClientStockClient in order to test it.

``` java
class WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest {
    @Test
    void shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService() {
        WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient = new WebClientStockClient();
    }
}
```

\
One of the things we can do with test driven development is to code
against the API we want, instead of testing something we've already
created. IntelliJ IDEA makes this easier because we can create the test
to look the way we want, and then generate the correct code from that,
usually using Alt+Enter.

1.  In the test, call a method pricesFor on WebClientStockClient. This
    method takes a String that represents the symbol of the stock we
    want the prices for.

``` java
void shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService() {
    WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient = new WebClientStockClient();
    webClientStockClient.pricesFor("SYMBOL");
}
```

\
(note: this code will not compile yet)

### Create a basic prices method on the client

1.  (Tip: press Alt+Enter on the red pricesFor method to get IntelliJ
    IDEA to create this method on WebClientStockClient, with the
    expected signature.)
2.  Change the method on WebClientStockClient to return a
    [Flux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html)
    of StockPrice objects.
3.  The simplest way to create a method that compiles so we can run our
    test against it, is to get this method to return an empty Flux:

``` java
public class WebClientStockClient {
    public Flux<StockPrice> pricesFor(String symbol) {
        return Flux.fromArray(new StockPrice[0]);
    }
}
```

\
(note: this code will not compile yet)

### Create a class to store stock prices

1.  (Tip: It's easiest to get IntelliJ IDEA to create the StockPrice
    class using Alt+Enter on the red StockPrice text.)
2.  Create StockPrice in the same package as WebClientStockClient

Here's where we're going to use [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/).
Using Lombok's [\@Data](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data)
annotation, we can create a data class similar to our [Kotlin data
class](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html) in the
first step of this tutorial. Using this, we only need to define the
properties of this class using fields, the getters, setters, equals,
hashCode, and toString methods are all provided by Lombok.

Use the [Lombok IntelliJ IDEA
plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij) to get code completion
and other useful features when working with Lombok.

1.  Add a String symbol, a Double price and a LocalDateTime time to the
    StockPrice class.
2.  Add an [\@AllArgsConstructor and a \@NoArgsConstructor via
    Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor), these are
    needed for our code and for JSON serialisation.

``` java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class StockPrice {
    private String symbol;
    private Double price;
    private LocalDateTime time;
}
```

### Add assertions to the test

We'll go back to WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest and add some
assertions, we need to check our returned Flux of prices meets our
expectations.

1.  Store the returned Flux in a prices local variable.
2.  Add an assertion that this is not null.
3.  Add an assertion that if we take five prices from the flux, we have
    more than one price.

``` java
@Test
void shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService() {
    // given
    WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient = new WebClientStockClient(webClient);

    // when
    Flux<StockPrice> prices = webClientStockClient.pricesFor("SYMBOL");

    // then
    Assertions.assertNotNull(prices);
    Assertions.assertTrue(prices.take(5).count().block() > 0);
}
```

\
When we run this test we see that it fails. It fails because the Flux
has zero elements in it, because that's what we hard-coded into the
client.

### Connect the client to the real service

Let's go back to WebClientStockClient and fill in the implementation.

1.  We want to use a WebClient to connect to the service. Create this as
    a field, and add a constructor parameter so that Spring
    automatically wires this in for us.

``` java
public class WebClientStockClient {
    private WebClient webClient;

    public WebClientStockClient(WebClient webClient) {
        this.webClient = webClient;
    }
// ...rest of the class here
```

\
Now we want to [use WebClient to call our REST
service](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-webclient)
inside our pricesFor method.

1.  Remove the stub code from prices for (i.e. delete
    `return Flux.fromArray(new StockPrice[0]);`)
2.  We're going to use the web client to make a GET request
    ([get()](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html#get--)).
3.  Give it the URI of our service
    (http://localhost:8080/stocks/{symbol}) and pass in the symbol.
4.  Call
    [retrieve()](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.RequestHeadersSpec.html#retrieve--).
5.  We need to say how to turn the response of this call into a Flux of
    some type, so we use
    [bodyToFlux()](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/ClientResponse.html#bodyToFlux-java.lang.Class-)
    and give it our data class, StockPrice.class.

``` java
public Flux<StockPrice> pricesFor(String symbol) {
    return webClient.get()
                    .uri("http://localhost:8080/stocks/{symbol}", symbol)
                    .retrieve()
                    .bodyToFlux(StockPrice.class);
}
```

\
These are the very basic requirements to get a reactive stream from a
GET call, but we can also define things like the retry and back off
strategy, remember that understanding the flow of data from publisher to
consumer is an important part of creating a successful reactive
application.

We can also define what to do when specific Exceptions are thrown. As an
example, we can say that when we see an IOException we want to log it.
We can use the [\@Log4j2 annotation from
Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/api/lombok/extern/log4j/Log4j2.html)
to give us access to the log, and log an error.

This is not the most robust way to handle errors, this simply shows that
we can consider Exceptions as a first class concern in our reactive
streams.\

``` java
import lombok.extern.log4j.Log4j2;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.Duration;

@Log4j2
public class WebClientStockClient {
    private WebClient webClient;

    public WebClientStockClient(WebClient webClient) {
        this.webClient = webClient;
    }

    public Flux<StockPrice> pricesFor(String symbol) {
        return webClient.get()
                        .uri("http://localhost:8080/stocks/{symbol}", symbol)
                        .retrieve()
                        .bodyToFlux(StockPrice.class)
                        .retryBackoff(5, Duration.ofSeconds(1), Duration.ofSeconds(20))
                        .doOnError(IOException.class, e -> log.error(e.getMessage()));
    }
}
```

### Run the integration test

Going back to WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest, we will see there are
some things we need to fix.

1.  We now need to give our client a WebClient. Create a WebClient field
    in the test.
2.  (Tip: Using [Smart
    Completion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html#smart_completion),
    Ctrl+Shift+Space, IntelliJ IDEA will even suggest the full call to
    the builder that can create a WebClient instance.)

``` java
class WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest {
    private WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder().build();

    @Test
    void shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService() {
        WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient = new WebClientStockClient(webClient);

// ...rest of the class
```

1.  In order to run the integration test the REST service must be
    running. Go back to StockServiceApplication from the first tutorial
    and run it.
2.  Run WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest. You can use the gutter
    icons or Ctrl+Shift+F10 for Windows or Linux (ΓîâΓçºR for macOS) from
    inside the test class file, or double-press Ctrl ("run anything")
    and type the test name.

We should see the test go green at this point. If we look at the output,
we can see we're decoding StockPrice objects with the symbol that we
used in the test, random prices and a time.

### More thorough assertions in the integration test

This is not the most thorough test, so let's add a bit more detail to
our assertions to make sure the client really is doing what we expect.
Let's change the assertion to require five prices when we take five
prices, and let's make sure that the symbol of one of the stock prices
is what we expect.\

``` java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

class WebClientStockClientIntegrationTest {
    private WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder().build();

    @Test
    void shouldRetrieveStockPricesFromTheService() {
        // given
        WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient = new WebClientStockClient(webClient);

        // when
        Flux<StockPrice> prices = webClientStockClient.pricesFor("SYMBOL");

        // then
        Assertions.assertNotNull(prices);
        Flux<StockPrice> fivePrices = prices.take(5);
        Assertions.assertEquals(5, fivePrices.count().block());
        Assertions.assertEquals("SYMBOL", fivePrices.blockFirst().getSymbol());
    }
}
```

### Summary

Testing reactive applications is a skill in its own right, and there are
[much better ways to do
it](https://www.baeldung.com/reactive-streams-step-verifier-test-publisher)
than we've shown in this simple example. However we have successfully
used an integration test to drive the API and functionality of our stock
prices client. This client connects to an endpoint that emits
[server-sent events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)
and returns a Flux of StockPrice objects that could be consumed by
another service. We'll show how to do this in later videos in this
tutorial.
