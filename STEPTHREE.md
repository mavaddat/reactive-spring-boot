This is the third part in our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). The original inspiration was a [70 minute
live
demo.](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)

This third step shows how to create a JavaFX application that is
launched and managed via Spring Boot, so that we can use Spring features
like [inversion of
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) in our
JavaFX application.

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

This step shows how to create a Spring Boot JavaFX Application, so that
JavaFX can take advantage of Spring features like [dependency
injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection).

### Setting up the module

In the video we re-use the client project we created for the previous
step, and add a new module to it. But if we wanted to create this as a
standalone project we could create this as a new project rather than a
new module, the steps would be very similar (replacing "new module" with
"new project").

1.  With the stock-client project from the previous step open in
    IntelliJ IDEA, [create a new
    module](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-modules.html#add-new-module).
2.  This is a Spring Boot application so [choose Spring Initializr from
    the options on the
    left](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html#create-spring-boot-project).
3.  We're using Java 13 as the SDK for this tutorial, although we're not
    using any of the Java 13 features (you can [download JDK
    13.0.1](http://jdk.java.net/13/) here, then [define a new IntelliJ
    IDEA SDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#define-sdk)
    for it).
4.  Enter the group name for the project, and call the artifact
    stock-ui.
5.  Keep the defaults of a Maven Project with Java and Jar packaging.
6.  We'll select Java 11 as the Java version as this is the [most recent
    Long Term
    Support](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/09/using-java-11-in-production-important-things-to-know/)
    version for Java, but for the purposes of this project it makes no
    difference.
7.  Enter a helpful description for the module, this is our third module
    so it helps us to keep clear in our mind what each module is
    responsible for.
8.  We can optionally change the default package structure if we wish.
9.  We don't need to select any Spring Boot Starters for this module.
10. Keep the default module name and location.

IntelliJ IDEA downloads the created project from Spring Initializr and
sets up the IDE correctly. If we're given the option to "show run
configurations in services", we can select this. The [services
window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/services-tool-window.html#Services_Tool_Window.xml)
is a slightly nicer and more useful way to see our running services and
can help us to manage microservice applications.

### The Spring Boot application class

As usual, Spring Boot generated a default application class for us. We
will need to change this in order to launch a JavaFX application but for
now we'll just leave this as it is.\

``` java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class StockUiApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(StockUiApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### Updating the Spring Boot settings

Since this is a JavaFX application and not a web application, add this
to the application.properties file of this module:

    spring.main.web-application-type=none

### Create a JavaFX application class

1.  Create a new Java class in the same package as the Spring
    application class and call it ChartApplication.
2.  (Tip: you can use Alt+Insert for Windows/Linux (ΓîÿN on macOS) in the
    [project
    window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/project-tool-window.html#Project_Tool_Window.xml)
    to create a new file or directory).
3.  Have it extend
    [javafx.application.Application](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html).

This is not currently on the classpath since we haven't added JavaFX to
our dependencies yet, so we need to add it to our pom.xml file.

1.  (Tip: pressing Alt+Enter on the red Application text in the editor
    gives the option to "[Add Maven
    Dependency](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-maven-dependencies.html#generate_maven_dependency)".)
2.  Add
    [org.openjfx:javafx-graphics](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openjfx/javafx-graphics/13.0.1)
    as a dependency, version 13.

&nbsp;

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
        <artifactId>javafx-graphics</artifactId>
        <version>13</version>
    </dependency>

1.  Now import
    [javafx.application.Application](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html)
    in ChartApplication.
2.  Application is an abstract class, so we need to override a method.
3.  (Tip: we can get IntelliJ IDEA to implement these methods by
    pressing Alt+Enter on the red error, selecting [Implement
    methods](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/implementing-methods-of-an-interface.html#Implementing_Methods_of_an_Interface.xml),
    and choosing the methods to implement.)
4.  We only have one method we need to implement,
    [start](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html#start(javafx.stage.Stage)).

``` java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class ChartApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        
    }
}
```

### Setting up the Spring Boot application class

Now we have a JavaFX application, we need to launch it from the Spring
Boot application.

Instead of using SpringApplication to run the application, we'll use the
JavaFX Application class, and call launch with the class that is our
JavaFX class, ChartApplication, and the application arguments.\

``` java
import javafx.application.Application;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class StockUiApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(ChartApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

\
The reason we need two separate application classes for our application
is because of [JavaFX and Java
Modules](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-June/021977.html),
it's beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the details. If we
want to use JavaFX and Spring together but aren't going to use [Java
Modules](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html)
from Java 9, this is one way to get it to work.

### Publishing events via the application context

Let's go back to our JavaFX application class, ChartApplication.

1.  Create a field applicationContext, this will be a
    [ConfigurableApplicationContext](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ConfigurableApplicationContext.html).
2.  Our start method, which is a standard JavaFX method, is called with
    a
    [Stage](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/Stage.html)
    object when the stage is ready to be used. We can use the Spring
    pattern of [publishing events via the application
    context](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-events) to signal when this
    Stage is ready. Inside start(), call
    applicationContext.[publishEvent](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEventPublisher.html#publishEvent-org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent-)()
    with a new StageReadyEvent.
3.  Pass the stage into the event constructor.

``` java
public class ChartApplication extends Application {
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        applicationContext.publishEvent(new StageReadyEvent(stage));
    }
}
```

\
Now we need to create our StageReadyEvent.

1.  Create it as an inner class in ChartApplication for simplicity. It
    can always be refactored out at a later date.
2.  (Tip: pressing Alt+Enter on the red StageReadyEvent offers the
    option to "Create inner class StageReadyEvent).
3.  In the StageReadyEvent constructor, pass the stage parameter into
    the super constructor.
4.  Make this inner class static and package visible, other classes will
    be listening for this event.

``` java
static class StageReadyEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    public StageReadyEvent(Stage stage) {
        super(stage);
    }
}
```

### Creating the application context

There are some other useful methods in Application that we can override
and make use of.

1.  Override the
    [init](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html#init())()
    method. This is where we need to initialise our application context.
2.  (Tip: you can use Ctrl+O within a class to [select superclass
    methods to
    override](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/overriding-methods-of-a-superclass.html#Overriding_Methods_of_a_Superclass.xml)).
3.  Create a new
    [SpringApplicationBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.html),
    and give it our Spring Boot application class, which is
    StockUiApplication.
4.  Call
    [run](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.html#run-java.lang.String...-)()
    to get the application context and assign it to the
    applicationContext field.

``` java
@Override
public void init() {
    applicationContext = new SpringApplicationBuilder(StockUiApplication.class).run();
}
```

### Closing the application context

Since we have an init() method, we should probably have some sort of
tear down or cleanup too.

1.  Override Application's
    [stop](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html#stop())
    method.
2.  Inside stop(), call
    applicationContext.[close](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ConfigurableApplicationContext.html#close--)().
3.  Also call
    [Platform.exit()](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Platform.html#exit())
    to end the JavaFX program.

``` java
@Override
public void stop() {
    applicationContext.close();
    Platform.exit();
}
```

\
Now we have our SpringBoot application class which launches our JavaFX
Application class, ChartApplication:\

``` java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.application.Platform;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

public class ChartApplication extends Application {
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @Override
    public void init() {
        applicationContext = new SpringApplicationBuilder(StockUiApplication.class).run();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        applicationContext.publishEvent(new StageReadyEvent(stage));
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        applicationContext.close();
        Platform.exit();
    }

    static class StageReadyEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
        public StageReadyEvent(Stage stage) {
            super(stage);
        }
    }
}
```

### Listening to application events

We need something which is going to listen to the StageReadyEvent that
we created.

1.  Create a new class, StageInitializer. This will set up our JavaFX
    Stage when it's ready.
2.  This class should be annotated as a Spring
    [\@Component](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html).
3.  This class needs to implement
    [ApplicationListener](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationListener.html),
    listening for our StageReadyEvent.
4.  We need to implement the method on this interface,
    [onApplicationEvent](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationListener.html#onApplicationEvent-E-).
5.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA can do this for us, press Alt+Enter on the red
    error and select "[Implement
    methods](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/implementing-methods-of-an-interface.html#Implementing_Methods_of_an_Interface.xml)").
6.  The onApplicationEvent takes a StageReadyEvent. Call getStage on the
    event and assign the result to a
    [Stage](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/Stage.html)
    local variable.

``` java
import com.mechanitis.demo.stockui.ChartApplication.StageReadyEvent;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class StageInitializer implements ApplicationListener<StageReadyEvent> {
    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
        Stage stage = event.getStage();
    }
}
```

\
(note: this code will not compile yet)

This method doesn't exist, so we need to create it on StageReadyEvent.

1.  (Tip: we can get IntelliJ IDEA to create this for us by pressing
    Alt+Enter on the red getStage method name in StageInitializer and
    selecting "Create method getStage").
2.  The superclass has a method that does what we want,
    [getSource](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/EventObject.html?is-external=true#getSource--).
    This returns an object, so call it and cast the returned value to a
    Stage.

``` java
static class StageReadyEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    public StageReadyEvent(Stage stage) {
        super(stage);
    }

    public Stage getStage() {
        return ((Stage) getSource());
    }
}
```

\
We know the source is a Stage because when we passed our stage
constructor parameter into the super constructor, this became the
source.

### Final steps

The Stage is ready for us to set up our user interface. We can run our
StockUIApplication, and see it successfully start up as a SpringBoot
application. It does also launch a Java process which would show a UI if
we had created one. For now, we have successfully created a JavaFX
application which is launched and managed with Spring, and allows us to
use the convenient features of any Spring application.
