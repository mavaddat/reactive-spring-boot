In this lesson we use Spring Profiles to enable an application to
determine which of our two clients ([server-sent events via
WebClient](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-server-sent-events), or
[RSocket](http://rsocket.io/)) to use to connect to our Kotlin Spring
Boot price service.

This is the final part of our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). The original inspiration was a [70 minute
live
demo.](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

Now we have an [RSocket client that lets us connect to our RSocket
server](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-java-rsocket-client/),
we want to use this from [our JavaFX
application](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-displaying-reactive-data/).

### Creating the RSocketStockClient Bean

We intentionally have two implementations of our StockClient, one for
connecting via RSocket and one via WebClient. Our ClientConfiguration
only exposes one of these, the WebClientStockClient, [as a
bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition).
If we want applications to be able to use the Rsocket client we need to
add an RSocket client bean as well.

1.  Create a new
    [\@Bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html)
    method on ClientConfiguration in the stock-client module, called
    rSocketStockClient, which returns a StockClient.
2.  The body of this method needs to return a new RSocketStockClient,
    which will need to take an rSocketRequester as a constructor
    argument.
3.  Add an
    [RSocketRequester](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/rsocket/RSocketRequester.html)
    as a method parameter to this rSocketStockClient method.
4.  (Tip: we can get IntelliJ IDEA to add the correct method parameter
    if we pass an unknown variable rSocketRequester into the
    RSocketStockClient constructor, [press
    Alt+Enter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/migrating-from-eclipse-to-intellij-idea.html#273a3d24)
    on the unknown variable and select "Create parameter".)
5.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate will warn you that this parameter can't
    be autowired because no beans match this type.)
6.  Create another \@Bean method called rSocketRequester that returns an
    RSocketRequester.
7.  Declare an
    [RSocketRequester.Builder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/rsocket/RSocketRequester.Builder.html)
    parameter `builder` for the method. This should be wired in
    automatically by Spring.
8.  Use the builder's
    [connectTcp](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/rsocket/RSocketRequester.Builder.html#connectTcp-java.lang.String-int-)
    method and give it "localhost" and port 7000 (that's where our
    Spring Boot RSocket server is running). Call block() to complete
    this connection.

``` java
@Configuration
public class ClientConfiguration {
    // WebClientStockClient bean method...

    @Bean
    public StockClient rSocketStockClient(RSocketRequester rSocketRequester) {
        return new RSocketStockClient(rSocketRequester);
    }

    @Bean
    public RSocketRequester rSocketRequester(RSocketRequester.Builder builder) {
        return builder.connectTcp("localhost", 7000).block();
    }

    // WebClient bean method...
}
```

### Choosing which bean to use

If we go to our JavaFX ChartController (in the stock-ui module), this is
the class that uses the StockClient to connect to the price service and
display prices on the chart. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate shows a warning in
this class that there's more than one Bean that matches the StockClient
type, our RSocket stock client and our WebClient stock client. We need
to figure out a way to specify which client we really want to use. One
way to do this is with [Spring
profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition-profiles-java).

1.  Add a
    [\@Profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Profile.html)
    annotation to the webClientStockClient method, passing in a value of
    `sse` (Server-Sent Events).
2.  Give the RSocketStockClient a
    [\@Profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Profile.html)
    of "rsocket".

``` java
@Bean
@Profile("sse")
public StockClient webClientStockClient(WebClient webClient) {
    return new WebClientStockClient(webClient);
}

@Bean
@Profile("rsocket")
public StockClient rSocketStockClient(RSocketRequester rSocketRequester) {
    return new RSocketStockClient(rSocketRequester);
}
```

### Selecting the active profile

If we're using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, when we go to the ChartController
we can see the error has gone away now. But we still [need to say which
profile we want to
use](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition-profiles-enable).

1.  Go to application.properties in the stock-ui module.
2.  Set the spring.profiles.active property to `sse`. This should give
    us the same bean and the same functionality that we had before.

&nbsp;

    # web-application and application title properties here...
    spring.profiles.active=sse

3.  Re-run the application, the application should start up as expected
    and the chart should show two sets of prices as before.
4.  Note in the run window that the JavaFX application has started up
    with the *sse* profile.

### Logging for debugging

If we want to be extra sure that we're using the bean we think we're
using, we could go back to the clients and add some logging.

1.  In the pricesFor method of WebClientStockClient add an info-level
    log message to state that this is the WebClient stock client.

``` java
public Flux<StockPrice> pricesFor(String symbol) {
    log.info("WebClient stock client");
    return // create Flux here...
}
```

2.  Do something similar for the RSocketStockClient.

``` default
public Flux<StockPrice> pricesFor(String symbol) {
    log.info("RSocket stock client");
    return // create Flux here...
}
```

3.  Re-run the application, we should see two log messages that we're
    using the WebClient stock client.

### Getting prices via RSocket

Let's finally use RSocket to get prices to display on our JavaFX line
chart.

1.  Go back to the application.properties file in stock-ui and change
    the active profile to `rsocket`.
2.  Re-run the application, everything should still works the way we
    expect. This time we're using the *rsocket* profile and connecting
    to the RSocket price server via the RSocketStockClient.

&nbsp;

    # web-application and application title properties here...
    spring.profiles.active=rsocket

So there we have it. A full end-to-end application with a JavaFX line
chart that subscribes to a reactive stream of prices from a Kotlin
Spring Boot application, and can be configured to get those prices
either via server sent events or via the new RSocket protocol.
