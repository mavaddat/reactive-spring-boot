In this lesson we add a new back end service in Kotlin, this time
emitting the prices via [RSocket](https://rsocket.io/), a protocol for
reactive streams.

This is the eighth part of our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). The original inspiration was a [70 minute
live
demo.](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

At this point in the tutorial series, we've successfully created an end
to end application that publishes prices from a Kotlin Spring Boot
service and [shows them on a JavaFX line
chart](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-displaying-reactive-data).
This uses HTTP and [server sent
events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events). However,
since this is a reactive application we might want to choose a protocol
that's better suited to streaming data.

In this step we're going to create a service that produces price data
via the [RSocket protocol](https://rsocket.io/).

### Creating an RSocket Controller

We're going to make these changes in the Kotlin Spring Boot application
that we created back in [Part
One](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-kotlin-rest-service/)
of this tutorial, our
[StockServiceApplication.kt](https://github.com/trishagee/s1p-stocks-service/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/mechanitis/demo/stocks/service/ServiceApplication.kt).
Our existing service has a REST Controller. We're going to create a
similar class for RSocket.

1.  Inside StockServiceApplication.kt, create a new class
    `RSocketController`.
2.  Annotated it as a Spring
    [Controller](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html).
3.  Create a new Kotlin function that takes a single argument.
4.  (Tip: we can use the *fun1* [Live
    Template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html)
    to get IntelliJ IDEA to create the outline of this function for us.)
5.  Call the function `prices`, the same as the `RestController`
    function. This takes a String symbol and returns a
    [Flux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html)
    of `StockPrice`.

``` java
@SpringBootApplication
class StockServiceApplication

// main function here...

@RestController
class RestController() {
    // controller body here...
}

@Controller
class RSocketController() {
    fun prices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        
    }
}

// StockPrice data class here
```

\
(note: this code will not compile yet, the function needs to return
something)

### Introducing a Price Service

This prices function is going to look a lot like the prices function in
the RestController since it's actually going to do the same thing. The
only difference is it's going to publish the prices in a different way.
To reduce duplication, let's introduce a price service that contains the
shared logic.

1.  Add a `priceService` constructor parameter of type `PriceService`.
2.  (Tip: if we type priceService into the prices method body, we can
    press Alt+Enter on the red text and get IntelliJ IDEA to "create
    property priceService as a constructor parameter")
3.  Create the `PriceService` class inside this same file.
4.  (Tip: we can press Alt+Enter on the red `PriceService` type in the
    constructor and get IntelliJ IDEA to "Create class PriceService" in
    this StockServiceApplication.kt file)
5.  Annotate the `PriceService` with
    @[Service](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html).

``` java
@SpringBootApplication
class StockServiceApplication

// main function here...

// @RestController here... 

@Controller
class RSocketController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    fun prices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        
    }
}

@Service
class PriceService {

}

// StockPrice data class here...
```

### Moving shared code into the PriceService

1.  Create a function called `generatePrices` in the service class.
2.  (Tip: if we call `priceService.generatePrices` from inside the
    prices function of `RSocketController`, we can press Alt+Enter on
    the red function call and get IntelliJ IDEA to generate the function
    for us.)
3.  This function needs to take a symbol of type String, and return a
    `Flux` of `StockPrice`, the same as our `prices` functions.
4.  The logic for this function already exists in
    `RestController.prices`, so copy the body of that function into the
    new `generatePrices` function.
5.  This needs the `randomStockPrice` function too, so copy this from
    `RestController` into `PriceService`.
6.  Make sure the prices method of `RSocketController` calls
    `generatePrices` and returns the results.

``` java
@SpringBootApplication
class StockServiceApplication

// main function here...

// @RestController here... 

@Controller
class RSocketController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    fun prices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        return priceService.generatePrices(symbol)
    }
}

@Service
class PriceService {
    fun generatePrices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        return Flux
            .interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .map { StockPrice(symbol, randomStockPrice(), now()) }
    }

    private fun randomStockPrice(): Double {
        return ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble(100.0)
    }
}

// StockPrice data class here...
```

### Reducing duplicated code

Now everything here is compiling, we can remove the duplicated code in
the RestController.

1.  Introduce a `priceService` constructor parameter to the
    `RestController`.
2.  Call `generatePrices` from inside `RestController.prices` instead of
    generating the prices there.
3.  Remove the `randomStockPrice` function inside `RestController` since
    it's not being used.
4.  (Tip: we can press Alt+Enter on the grey `randomStockPrices`
    function name and select [Safe
    delete](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/safe-delete.html) to
    remove this. Or we can use Alt+Delete/ΓîÿΓîª on the function name).

``` java
@RestController
class RestController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    @GetMapping(value = ["/stocks/{symbol}"],
                produces = [MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE])
    fun prices(@PathVariable symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        return priceService.generatePrices(symbol)
    }
}

@Controller
class RSocketController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    fun prices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        return priceService.generatePrices(symbol)
    }
}

@Service
class PriceService {
    fun generatePrices(symbol: String): Flux<StockPrice> {
        return Flux
            .interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .map { StockPrice(symbol, randomStockPrice(), now()) }
    }

    private fun randomStockPrice(): Double {
        return ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble(100.0)
    }
}
```

### Refactoring to reduce boilerplate

The prices functions on both the RestController and the
RSocketController are now simply calling the PriceService, so all the
common code is in one place. Kotlin allows us to simplify this code even
further.

1.  Convert the `prices` function to an [expression
    body](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#defining-functions)
    and remove the declared return type.
2.  (Tip: if we press Alt+Enter on the curly braces of the function,
    IntelliJ IDEA offers the option of "Convert to expression body".
    Once we've done this, the return type will be highlighted and we can
    easily delete it.)
3.  Do this with both `prices` functions.

``` java
@RestController
class RestController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    @GetMapping(value = ["/stocks/{symbol}"],
                produces = [MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE])
    fun prices(@PathVariable symbol: String) = priceService.generatePrices(symbol)

}

@Controller
class RSocketController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    fun prices(symbol: String) = priceService.generatePrices(symbol)
}
```

\
Because this function is a simple delegation, this might be a more
useful, and certainly shorter, way to write it.

### Setting up the message mapping

The RestController function is annotated with GetMapping, which sets up
the URL for clients to connect to consume this stream of prices. We need
to do something similar for the RSocketController function.

1.  Add a
    [MessageMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/handler/annotation/MessageMapping.html)
    annotation onto `RSocketController.prices`.
2.  Add the dependency `spring-boot-starter-rsocket` to the pom.xml
    file.
3.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA can help us here with code completion in
    pom.xml, or you can [generate a
    dependency](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-maven-dependencies.html))

``` xhtml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-rsocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

4.  Back in our StockServiceApplication file, we can add an import for
    MessageMapping.
5.  Pass in to the \@MessageMapping annotation a String route so that
    clients can connect.

``` java
@Controller
class RSocketController(val priceService: PriceService) {
    @MessageMapping("stockPrices")
    fun prices(symbol: String) = priceService.generatePrices(symbol)
}
```

### Setting up an RSocket server

If we start the application now, we can see which servers have been
started. At this time, we should only have Netty on port 8080. We want
an RSocket server as well.

1.  Go to application.properties and define an RSocket server port
    as 7000.

&nbsp;

    spring.rsocket.server.port=7000

Simply defining the port here is enough to get Spring Boot to start an
RSocket server for us, so when we re-start the application, we will see
a Netty RSocket server started on port 7000 (for an example see [the end
of the video](https://youtu.be/JYg159twPYE?t=281)).

Now we have a prices service started on port 7000 ready for a client to
connect to it to receive stock prices via RSocket. Stay tuned for the
next lesson, where we'll connect to this server and consume the prices.
