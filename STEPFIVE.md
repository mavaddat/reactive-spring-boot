In this lesson we look at how to use Spring beans from one module in a
different module, using auto-configuration.

This is the fifth part of our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). The original inspiration was a [70 minute
live
demo.](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

In the [last
lesson](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-javafx-line-chart),
we created a JavaFX Spring Boot application that shows an empty line
chart. In this video, we're going to see how to set up
auto-configuration for Spring Beans so that we can use beans defined in
our stock-client module in the stock-ui module.

### Adding a dependency upon another module

1.  Open the ChartController class we created in the last lesson. This
    class is going to be responsible for updating the data we display on
    the line chart.
2.  Our ChartController needs to use the WebClientStockClient from the
    [second
    lesson](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-rest-client-for-reactive-streams/),
    it will use this to connect to the stock prices service. Create a
    new field for the client and make sure the class is imported.

``` java
public class ChartController {
    @FXML
    public LineChart<String, Double> chart;
    private WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient;
}
```

3.  We need to add a dependency upon stock-client from the stock-ui
    module
4.  (Tip: we can get get IntelliJ IDEA to add this dependency by
    pressing Alt+Enter on the red field, and selecting "[Add maven
    dependency](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-maven-dependencies.html)".
    It will add the dependency in the Maven pom.xml file, so this
    dependency is managed by the build file not by the IDE.)

``` xhtml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mechanitis</groupId>
    <artifactId>stock-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

5.  Add a constructor parameter so it gets wired in.
6.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA will offer to add a constructor parameter if we
    press Alt+Enter on the grey field name, or we can [generate
    constructors](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-code.html#generate-constructors)).

``` java
public class ChartController {
    @FXML
    public LineChart<String, Double> chart;
    private WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient;

    public ChartController(WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient) {
        this.webClientStockClient = webClientStockClient;
    }
}
```

### Creating the WebClientStockClient bean

IntelliJ IDEA helps us identify a problem in ChartController by telling
us there are no beans of type WebClientStockClient available. Let's fix
this.

1.  In the stock-client module, we need to create a new Java class,
    ClientConfiguration, and add the
    [Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html)
    annotation. Here we'll define our Beans.
2.  Create a method annotated with
    [\@Bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html)
    that returns a WebClientStockClient. To create one of these we need
    to pass in a webClient parameter.
3.  (Tip: We can get IntelliJ IDEA to pass in a parameter for this by
    pressing Alt+Enter on the red webClient variable and selecting
    "create parameter").
4.  Define another
    [\@Bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html)
    method, which returns a WebClient. We can use the WebClient builder
    with default settings to create a new instance.
5.  We can also annotate this method with
    [ConditionalOnMissingBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/condition/ConditionalOnMissingBean.html),
    which means this method will only be used to create the bean if a
    WebClient bean doesn't already exist. We're using this here because
    it's possible that something else that uses this code might also
    create a WebClient.

``` java
@Configuration
public class ClientConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public WebClientStockClient webClientStockClient(WebClient webClient) {
        return new WebClientStockClient(webClient);
    }

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public WebClient webClient() {
        return WebClient.builder().build();
    }
}
```

### Enabling Auto-configuration

Back in the stock-ui module, IntelliJ IDEA tells us we still can't see
this bean. That's because it was defined in a different module and this
module can't see the beans defined there. We're going to use [Spring
Boot's
auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-developing-auto-configuration)
to help us here.

1.  Create a META-INF directory in stock-client src/main/resources.
2.  Inside this create a file,
    [spring.factories](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-locating-auto-configuration-candidates).
3.  In spring.factories, set the property
    [EnableAutoConfiguration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/EnableAutoConfiguration.html)
    to point to our ClientConfiguration class. This will give other
    modules that use this module access to the beans in our
    ClientConfiguration.

&nbsp;

    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=com.mechanitis.demo.stockclient.ClientConfiguration

Now when we go back to our ChartController class, it knows where to find
the webClientStockClient bean.

### Conclusion

This was a fairly small step in the tutorial, but it lets us create
modules that can be re-used by different Spring Boot applications. Now
this step is complete, we can use the client in ChartController to
connect to the price service and start showing real-time prices on the
line chart.
