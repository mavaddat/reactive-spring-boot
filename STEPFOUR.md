In this step we see how to create a JavaFX application that shows a
[line
chart](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/user-interface-tutorial/line-chart.htm#CIHGBCFI).
This application uses Spring for features like [inversion of
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).

This is the fourth part in our tutorial showing how to build a Reactive
application using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java and
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). The original inspiration was a [70 minute
live
demo.](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/)

This blog post contains a video showing the process step-by-step and a
textual walk-through (adapted from the transcript of the video) for
those who prefer a written format.

[This tutorial is a series of
steps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/)
during which we will build a full [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application featuring a
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) back end, a
[Java](https://jdk.java.net/13/) client and a
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) user interface.

This step continues our integration of JavaFX and Spring, and at the end
of it we'll be able to show an empty [line
chart](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/user-interface-tutorial/line-chart.htm#CIHGBCFI).
We'll populate it with data later in the tutorial.

### Creating the Scene

1.  Open the stock-client project that we created back in [step
    2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-rest-client-for-reactive-streams),
    and go back to the
    [stock-ui](https://github.com/trishagee/s1p-stocks-ui/tree/master/ui)
    module that we created in [step
    3](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-javafx-spring-boot-application).
2.  Open StageInitializer, we're going to update this to display the
    user interface for the application.
3.  In onApplicationEvent, call stage.setScene() and give it a parent
    (currently undefined) and a width and height, 800 by 600.

``` java
public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
    Stage stage = event.getStage();
    stage.setScene(new Scene(parent, 800, 600));
}
```

\
(note: this code will not compile yet)

1.  Create parent as a local variable of type
    [Parent](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Parent.html).
2.  (Tip: If you press Alt+Enter on the red parent text and choose
    "Create local variable" IntelliJ IDEA creates the variable and works
    out this needs to be of type Parent.)
3.  Call stage.show() after initialising the stage.

``` java
public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
    Parent parent;
    Stage stage = event.getStage();
    stage.setScene(new Scene(parent, 800, 600));
    stage.show();
}
```

\
Now we need to work out where this parent is going to come from.

### Using FXML

We're going to use
[FXML](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html)
to define which elements are on the user interface. Declaring the view
elements in FXML gives a nice clean separation between the view and the
model and controller if we're following an
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
pattern.

1.  Declare an
    [FXMLLoader](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html)
    local variable in the onApplicationEvent method.

``` java
public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader;
    Parent parent;

    // ...rest of the method
}
```

\
We haven't declared a dependency on FXML classes yet, so let's add a
Maven dependency.

1.  In our pom.xml file, we need to add a dependency on javafx-fxml.
2.  (Tip: pressing Alt+Enter on the red FXMLLoader text in the editor
    gives the option to "[Add Maven
    Dependency](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-maven-dependencies.html#generate_maven_dependency)".)
3.  Add
    [org.openjfx:javafx-fxml](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openjfx/javafx-fxml/13)
    as a dependency, version 13.

``` xhtml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId>
    <version>13</version>
</dependency>
```

1.  Now import the
    [FXMLLoader](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html)
    class in StageInitializer.
2.  (Tip: pressing Alt+Enter on the red FXMLLoader text in the editor
    gives the option to "[Import
    class](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#Creating_and_Optimizing_Imports.xml)",
    or IntelliJ IDEA can do this without prompting [if auto-import is
    set up this
    way](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#automatically-add-import-statements).)
3.  Create a chartResource field in the StageInitializer, it's going to
    be a Spring
    [Resource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html).
4.  We can use the
    [\@Value](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html)
    annotation to tell Spring where to find the file, let's say it's on
    the classpath and it's a file called chart.fxml.
5.  In the FXMLLoader constructor, pass in
    chartResource.[getURL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html#getURL--)().
6.  This getURL throws an Exception, so surround the call with a
    try/catch block. In the catch section we'll throw a new
    RuntimeException for the purposes of keeping the tutorial simple,
    but this is not a useful way to deal with Exceptions in production
    code.
7.  Now we can finally initialise our parent, by calling
    fxmlLoader.[load](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html#load())().

``` java
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.*;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;
import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import java.io.IOException;

@Component
public class StageInitializer implements ApplicationListener<StageReadyEvent> {
    @Value("classpath:/chart.fxml")
    private Resource chartResource;

    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
        try {
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(chartResource.getURL());
            Parent parent = fxmlLoader.load();

            Stage stage = event.getStage();
            stage.setScene(new Scene(parent, 800, 600));
            stage.show();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating the FXML file

1.  Go to the resources directory (src/main/resources) and create a new
    FXML file, chart.fxml.
2.  (Tip: If you create a "new FXML file" using IntelliJ IDEA, you'll
    get a basic FXML file created for you.)
3.  The top level element should be a
    [VBox](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/layout/VBox.html),
    if the file was created by IntelliJ IDEA we need to change it from
    AnchorPane to VBox.
4.  Make sure the VBox has an
    [fx:controller](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html#controllers)
    property with a value of ChartController.
5.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA has code generation even inside the FXML file,
    so we can create this missing controller class by pressing Alt+Enter
    on the red ChartController text and selecting "Create class".)
6.  Create the ChartController in the same package as all the other
    classes. Make sure the path to the controller in fx:controller
    contains the full package name.
7.  We can use [Optimize
    Imports](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#optimize-imports)
    to remove all the unnecessary imports from the FXML file.

``` xhtml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?>
<VBox xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx"
      xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml"
      fx:controller="ChartController">

</VBox>
```

\
Start this application, by going back to the SpringBootApplication class
and [running
it](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html) using
Ctrl+Shift+F10 for windows or Ctrl+Shift+R for macOS.

A Java window should pop up with the dimensions we set in the Stage.
There's nothing in there yet as we haven't put anything into the view.

### Setting the application title

We're going to make a small change to see that we can control what is
displayed in the window.

1.  Go back to StageInitializer, and add a line to set the title of the
    view to be applicationTitle.
2.  Create a String field for applicationTitle.
3.  (Tip: we can get IntelliJ IDEA to create a constructor with the
    appropriate parameters to initialise this field.)
4.  Adding a constructor parameter to populate this field means we can
    use Spring to populate the value of this title.
5.  Use the \@Value annotation to set a default value for this
    parameter.

``` java
public class StageInitializer implements ApplicationListener<StageReadyEvent> {
    @Value("classpath:/chart.fxml")
    private Resource chartResource;
    private String applicationTitle;

    public StageInitializer(@Value("Demo title") String applicationTitle) {
        this.applicationTitle = applicationTitle;
    }

    public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
        try {
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(chartResource.getURL());
            Parent parent = fxmlLoader.load();

            Stage stage = event.getStage();
            stage.setScene(new Scene(parent, 800, 600));
            stage.setTitle(applicationTitle);
            stage.show();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
    }
}
```

\
When we re-run the application, we should see JavaFX uses this new title
in the title bar

### Setting an application title from application.properties

Hard-coding string values is not good practice for a number of reasons,
so let's get this title from somewhere else.

1.  In
    src/main/resources/[application.properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html),
    add a new property called spring.application.ui.title, and set a
    value for the title.

&nbsp;

    spring.application.ui.title=Stock Prices

1.  In StageInitializer, we can use
    [SpEL](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions)
    to say that we want to use this property for the title of our
    application. Change the \@Value of application title to point to
    this property

``` java
public StageInitializer(@Value("${spring.application.ui.title}") String applicationTitle) {
    this.applicationTitle = applicationTitle;
}
```

\
Now when we run the application (for example by [pressing Ctrl twice to
Run
Anything](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html#d4d5314b)),
we should see this value from application properties used as the title
of the window.

### Get JavaFX controllers from Spring

There's one last thing we need to do to make the most of Spring in this
JavaFX application, and that's to be able to use the beans from the
application context in the JavaFX wiring.

1.  Call
    [setControllerFactory](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html#setControllerFactory(javafx.util.Callback))
    on our fxmlLoader. We need to give this a lambda expression that,
    given a class, returns an Object. This sounds like a job for the
    [Spring application
    context](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-basics).
2.  Create an
    [ApplicationContext](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html)
    field called applicationContext.
3.  Add a new constructor parameter for this field so that is
    initialised.
4.  (Tip: if you press Alt+Enter on a field that has not been
    initialised, IntelliJ IDEA will offer the option to add a
    constructor parameter.)
5.  Now we can call getBean on applicationContext within the
    setControllerFactory lambda parameter to provide the controllers
    that JavaFX needs.

``` java
// ...start of class happens above this line
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    public StageInitializer(@Value("${spring.application.ui.title}") String applicationTitle, 
                            ApplicationContext applicationContext) {
        this.applicationTitle = applicationTitle;
        this.applicationContext = applicationContext;
    }

    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(StageReadyEvent event) {
        try {
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(chartResource.getURL());
            fxmlLoader.setControllerFactory(aClass -> applicationContext.getBean(aClass));
// ...rest of the class
```

### Creating a line chart

All our wiring is complete, so let's finally create our line chart.

1.  In chart.fxml, inside the VBox, we'll declare we want a
    [LineChart](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.controls/javafx/scene/chart/LineChart.html).
2.  We need to add, as a sub element, an xAxis.
3.  Inside xAxis, add a
    [CategoryAxis](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.controls/javafx/scene/chart/CategoryAxis.html),
    this means the x-axis is going to have strings as values. This is
    our Time axis so add a label of "Time".
4.  At the same level as xAxis, add a yAxis.
5.  Inside the yAxis, declare a
    [NumberAxis](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.controls/javafx/scene/chart/NumberAxis.html).
    This axis is for the stock price, so add a label of "Price".
6.  Set the height of the chart to 600 by setting the prefHeight
    property on LineChart to 600.
7.  We need to give the LineChart an fx:id, which is the ID of the field
    in the ChartController that will contain the reference to this
    LineChart. Let's call it "chart".

``` xhtml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?>
<?import javafx.scene.chart.LineChart?>
<?import javafx.scene.chart.CategoryAxis?>
<?import javafx.scene.chart.NumberAxis?>
<VBox xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx"
      xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml"
      fx:controller="com.mechanitis.demo.stockui.ChartController">
    <LineChart prefHeight="600" fx:id="chart">
        <xAxis>
            <CategoryAxis label="Time"/>
        </xAxis>
        <yAxis>
            <NumberAxis label="Price"/>
        </yAxis>
    </LineChart>
</VBox>
```

1.  (Tip: IntelliJ IDEA can identify there's no field called chart in
    the controller class. Press Alt+Enter on the "chart" value of fx:id
    and select "Create field 'chart\'", and the IDE will generate the
    correct field on ChartController.)
2.  ChartController should have a LineChart field called chart. We said
    the chart has a String x axis and a Number y axis, so we can declare
    this as a LineChart\<String, Double>
3.  We can add the
    [FXML](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXML.html)
    annotation to show this field is populated from an FXML file.
4.  Make sure ChartController is annotated as a Spring
    [\@Component](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html).

``` java
import javafx.fxml.FXML;
import javafx.scene.chart.LineChart;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ChartController {

    @FXML
    public LineChart<String, Double> chart;
}
```

\
Now when we run the application, we should see the outline of a line
chart shown in our window, with numbers for our price y axis, and time
on the x axis.

┬á

We have successfully created a JavaFX application that is integrated
into Spring Boot, that uses FXML to declare what should be in the view.
In the following videos of this tutorial, we'll get this chart updating
itself with stock prices in real time.
